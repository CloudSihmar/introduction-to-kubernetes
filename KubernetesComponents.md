# Kubernetes Components

## Cluster & Node

A <b>Kubernetes cluster</b> is a set of node machines (virtual or physical) for running containerized applications. 

    If you’re running Kubernetes, you’re running a cluster.

A <b>Node</b> is a machine (physical or virtual) on which Kubernetes is installed. A Node is a worker machine, and that is where containers will be launched by Kubernetes.

If the Node on which your application is running fails, our application goes down. so we need to have more than one Nodes. A Cluster is a set of Nodes grouped together, If one Node fails, our application is still accessible from the other Nodes. Moreover, having multiple Nodes helps in sharing load as well.

In a Cluster, we need a master who is responsible for managing the Cluster, store the information about members of the Cluster, monitor the status of Nodes and move the workload of the failed Node to another Worker Node. 

The Master is another Node with Kubernetes installed in it and is configured as a Master. The Master watches over the Nodes in the Cluster and is responsible for the actual orchestration of containers on the Worker Nodes. Master is not required to be a single node. So the management part is called as Control Plane. 

The control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Nodes actually run the applications and workloads.

When you install Kubernetes on a system, you're actually installing the following components, 

> - [Control Plane Components](ControlPlaneComponents.md): 
>   - API server 
>   - etcd service
>   - controllers
>   - kube-controller-manager
>   - cluster-controller-manager
>   - scheduler 

> - [Node Components](NodeComponents.md)    
>   - kubelet service, 
>   - kube-proxy
>   - container runtime
