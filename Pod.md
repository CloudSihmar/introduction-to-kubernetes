## Pod

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

In Kubernetes, instead of deploying containers individually, you always deploy and operate on a pod of containers. It’s common for pods to contain only a single container. 

    When a pod contains multiple containers, all of them are always run on a single worker node—it never spans multiple worker nodes.

    In Kubernetes, pods live and die, not individual containers.

    All containers of a pod: 
     - share the same set of Linux namespaces instead of each container having its own set.
     - share the same hostname and network interfaces.
     - share the same IP address and port space.   
     - run under the same IPC namespace and can communicate through IPC.

Pods are logical hosts and behave much like physical hosts or VMs in the non-container world. Processes running in the same pod are like processes running on the same physical or virtual machine, except that each process is encapsulated in a container.

A pod is also the basic unit of scaling. Kubernetes can’t horizontally scale individual containers; instead, it scales whole pods.

Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:

* <b>Pods that run a single container:</b> The "one-container-per-Pod" model is the most common Kubernetes use case

* <b>Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together:</b> A Pod can encapsulate an application composed of multiple co-located containers that are tightly coupled and need to share resources. These co-located containers form a single cohesive unit of service. For example, one container serving data stored in a shared volume to the public, while a separate sidecar container refreshes or updates those files. The Pod wraps these containers, storage resources, and an ephemeral network identity together as a single unit. The main reason to put multiple containers into a single pod is when the application consists of one main process and one or more complementary processes.

Deciding when to use multiple containers in a pod:
* Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?
* Do they represent a single whole or are they independent components?
* Must they be scaled together or individually?

A container shouldn’t run multiple processes. A pod shouldn’t contain multiple containers if they don’t need to run on the same machine.

Usually you don't need to create Pods directly, even singleton Pods. Instead, create them using workload resources such as Deployment or Job.

### Creating Pods
Pods are usually created by posting a JSON or YAML manifest to the Kubernetes REST API endpoint. 

The pod definition consists following main parts:
* apiVersion: Kubernetes API version used in the YAML
* kind: the type of resource the YAML is describing
* metadata: Includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about the pod.
* spec: Contains the actual description of the pod’s contents, such as the pod’s containers, volumes, and other data.
* <i>status: contains the current information about the running pod, such as what condition the pod is in, the description and status of each container, and the pod’s internal IP and other basic info.</i>

    The status part contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given moment. When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part.

### Organizing Pods with Labels
With microservices architectures, the number of deployed microservices can easily reach high values. Those components will probably be replicated (multiple copies of the same component will be deployed) and multiple versions or releases (stable, beta, canary, and so on) will run concurrently. This can lead to hundreds of pods in the system. Without a mechanism for organizing them, you end up with a big, incomprehensible mess.

Organizing pods and all other Kubernetes objects is done through labels.

Labels go hand in hand with label selectors. Label selectors allow you to select a subset of pods tagged with certain labels and perform an operation on those pods. A label selector is a criterion, which filters resources based on whether they include a certain label with a certain value.

### Using labels and selectors to constrain pod scheduling

Labels and label selectors can be used to constrain pod scheduling. As an example, let one of the nodes in your cluster contains a GPU to be used for general-purpose GPU computing. You add the label gpu=true to the nodes showing this feature.

Now imagine you want to deploy a new pod that needs a GPU to perform its work. To ask the scheduler to only choose among the nodes that provide a GPU, you’ll add a node selector to the pod’s YAML.

### Removing Pods

Delete pod by name: <i>kubectl delete po pod-name</i>

Deleting pods using label selectors: <i>kubectl delete po -l label=value</i>

Deleting all pods in a namespace :<i>kubectl delete po --all</i>

Deleting pods by deleting the whole namespace: <i>kubectl delete ns custom_namespace</i>
