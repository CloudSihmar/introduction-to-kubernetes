# Jobs

Just as we may need to redesign our applications to be decoupled, we may also consider that microservices may not need to run all the time. The use of Jobs and CronJobs can further assist with implementing decoupled and transient microservices.

Jobs are part of the batch API group. They are used to run a set number of pods to completion. If a pod fails, it will be restarted until the number of completion is reached.

While they can be seen as a way to do batch processing in Kubernetes, they can also be used to run one-off pods. A Job specification will have a parallelism and a completion key. If omitted, they will be set to one. If they are present, the parallelism number will set the number of pods that can run concurrently, and the completion number will set how many pods need to run successfully for the Job itself to be considered done. Several Job patterns can be implemented, like a traditional work queue. 

Cronjobs work in a similar manner to Linux jobs, with the same time syntax. There are some cases where a job would not be run during a time period or could run twice; as a result, the requested Pod should be idempotent. 

An option spec field is .spec.concurrencyPolicy, which determines how to handle existing jobs, should the time segment expire. If set to Allow, the default, another concurrent job will be run. If set to Forbid, the current job continues and the new job is skipped. A value of Replace cancels the current job and starts a new job in its place.

Kubernetes includes support for creation of pods that terminates after process running inside finishes successfully and not restarted again.

In the event of a node failure, the pods on that node that are managed by a Job will be rescheduled to other nodes.

In the event of a failure of the process itself (when the process returns an error exit code), the Job can be configured to either restart the container or not.

* Run multiple pod instances in a Job
    * Run job pods sequentially
    * Run job pods in parallel
    * Scale a Job
* Limit the time allowed for a Job pod to complete

## Creating Jobs

You can define a Job object via yaml file. Here is an example Job config. It computes π to 2000 places and prints it out. It takes around 10s to complete.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

# CronJobs

Job resources run their pods immediately when you create the Job resource. But many batch jobs need to be run at a specific time in the future or repeatedly in the specified interval. In Linux- and UNIX-like operating systems, these jobs are better known as cron jobs. Kubernetes supports them, too. A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.

A cron job in Kubernetes is configured by creating a CronJob resource. At the configured time, Kubernetes will create a Job resource according to the Job template configured in the CronJob object. When the Job resource is created, one or more pod replicas will be created and started according to the Job’s pod template.

This example CronJob manifest prints the current time and a hello message every minute:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
```
