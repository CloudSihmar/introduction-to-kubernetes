# Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. 

They can describe:

* What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)

* The resources available to those applications

* The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance

A Kubernetes object is a "record of intent". By creating an object, you're effectively telling the Kubernetes system what you want your cluster's workload to look like; this is your cluster's desired state.

## Describing a Kubernetes object

To work with Kubernetes objects (create, modify, or delete) you'll need to use the Kubernetes API. <i>kubectl</i> is Kubernetes command-line tool. kubectl allows you to run commands (deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs) against Kubernetes clusters via Kubernetes API.

When you create an object in Kubernetes, you must provide the object spec that describes its desired state, as well as some basic information about the object (such as a name).

Most often, the information about the objects are provided in .yaml (or .yml) file to kubectl. Kubernetes objects are usually created by posting a JSON or YAML manifest to the Kubernetes REST API endpoint. Defining Kubernetes objects from YAML files makes it possible to store them in a version control system.

### Required fields in YAML files

In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:

* apiVersion - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object

* kind - What kind of object you want to create
* metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
* spec - What state you desire for the object

The precise format of the object spec is different for every Kubernetes object, and contains nested fields specific to that object.
