## Node Components

### kubelet

An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It talks to the API server and manages containers on its node. 

### k-proxy

kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. It maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

### container run time

The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.

Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).
